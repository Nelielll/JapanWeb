                 <p style="margin-left:50px; color:whitesmoke;"> <i>The print Red Fuji from Hokusai's series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji</i></p>
                 <p class="textc"> <b>The work has been described as "one of the simplest and at the same time one of the most outstanding of all Japanese prints".
                     In early autumn when, as the title specifies, the wind is southerly and the sky is clear, the rising sun can turn Mount Fuji red. 
                     Hokusai captures this moment with compositional abstraction but meteorological specificity, especially when compared to the rest of the series. 
                     The three shades of deepening blue of the sky mirror the three hues of the mountain. The lingering remnants of snow at the peak of the mountain and dark shadows encompassing the forest at its base place it very precisely in time.[4] 
                     Mount Fuji's solidly symmetrical shape on the right half of the image is balanced by the delicate clouds to the left, for a striking composition.</b>

                     The word for music in Japanese is 音楽 (ongaku), combining the kanji 音 "on" (sound) with the kanji 楽 "gaku" (enjoyment).
                     Japan is the second largest music market in the world, behind the United States, and the largest in Asia, and most of the market is dominated by Japanese artists.</b>

                 <p class="textc"> <b>The taiko (太鼓), is a Japanese drum that comes in various sizes and is used to play a variety of musical genres.
                      It has become particularly popular in recent years as the central instrument of percussion ensembles whose repertory is based on a variety of folk and festival music of the past. 
                      Such taiko music is played by large drum ensembles called kumi-daiko. 
                      Its origins are uncertain, but can be stretched out as far back as the 7th centuries, when a clay figure of a drummer indicates its existence. </b>

                 <p class="textc"> <b>Japanese architecture has as long of a history as any other aspect of Japanese culture. Originally heavily influenced by Chinese architecture, it has developed many differences and aspects which are indigenous to Japan. Examples of traditional architecture are seen at temples, Shinto shrines, and castles in Kyoto and Nara. Some of these buildings are constructed with traditional gardens, which are influenced from Zen ideas.
                        Some modern architects, such as Yoshio Taniguchi and Tadao Ando are known for their amalgamation of Japanese traditional and Western architectural influences. </b>

                     Machiya typically occupied deep, narrow plots abutting the street (the width of the plot was usually indicative of the wealth of the owner), often with a workshop or shop on the ground floor. 
                     Tiles rather than thatch were used on the roof and exposed timbers were often plastered in an effort to protect the building against fire. 
                     Ostentatious buildings that demonstrated the wealth and power of the feudal lords were constructed, such as the Kamiyashiki of Matsudaira Tadamasa or the Ōzone Shimoyashiki.</b>

                 <p class="textc"> <b>Shintoism is an ethnic religion that focuses on ceremonies and rituals.
                      In Shintoism, followers believe that kami, a Shinto deity or spirit, are present throughout nature, including rocks, trees, and mountains.
                       Humans can also be considered to possess a kami. One of the goals of Shintoism is to maintain a connection between humans, nature, and kami. 
                     The religion developed in Japan prior to the sixth century C.E., after which point followers built shrines to worship kami.</b>

                 <p class="textc"> <b>Buddhism developed in India around the 6th and 4th centuries BCE and eventually spread through China and Korea.
                      It arrived in Japan during the 6th century C.E., where it was initially unpopular.
                       Most Japanese people were unable to understand the difficult philosophical messages present in Buddhism, however they did have an appreciation for the religion's art, which is believed to have led to the religion growing more popular.
                        Buddhism is concerned with the soul and life after dying. In the religion a person's status was unimportant, as every person would get sick, age, die, and eventually be reincarnated into a new life, a cycle called saṃsāra. The suffering people experienced during life was one way for people to gain a better future.
                      The ultimate goal was to escape the cycle of death and rebirth by attaining true insight.</b>

                 <p class="textc"> <b>Japanese cuisine is based on combining the staple food, which is steamed white rice or gohan (御飯), with one or several okazu or main dishes and side dishes. 
                     This may be accompanied by a clear or miso soup and tsukemono (pickles).
                     Rice is served in its own small bowl (chawan), and each course item is placed on its own small plate (sara) or bowl (hachi) for each individual portion. 
                     This is done even at home. It contrasts with the Western-style dinners at home, where each individual takes helpings from the large serving dishes of food presented at the middle of the dining table.</b>

                 <p class="textc"> <b>The Japanese say “itadakimasu” at the beginning of their meals. People live off of the lives of animals and plants. “Itadakimasu” is said to express gratitude for “receiving (itadaku)” the life of another entity.
                        “Gochisosama” is used at the end of meals. It is paired with “itadakimasu” and said to express gratitude to the party or parties involved in the preparing of the dish. It was originally a Buddhist term, but used by everyone regardless of their religious beliefs.
                        It is even more proper if you place your hands together and slightly bow when saying either “itadakimasu” or “gochisosama”. </b>
